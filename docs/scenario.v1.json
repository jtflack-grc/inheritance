These systems monitor animals, assess welfare, optimize environments, and make automated decisions. With welfare now in AI governance, you must decide how to regulate both animal welfare standards and ensure AI systems prioritize welfare over efficiency.",
          "vignette": "Factory farming operates at massive scale: ~70 billion land animals annually. AI systems are deployed throughout: computer vision monitors behavior 24/7, predictive models forecast health issues, automated systems adjust feed, temperature, and environments. These systems are currently optimized for efficiency and cost. With welfare integrated into AI governance, they must now prioritize welfare—but how? Welfare standards (space allowances, enrichment, slaughter methods) directly impact production costs: EU cage-free egg mandates increased costs 30-40%. Enforcement requires inspection infrastructure, trained personnel, and oversight of AI systems to ensure they actually optimize for welfare, not just efficiency. Trade implications exist—stricter standards may disadvantage domestic producers vs. imports from jurisdictions with lower standards or AI systems optimized for efficiency.",

Evidence for sentience varies by taxa: strong for cephalopods/decapods (UK 2022 recognition), emerging for insects. AI systems are being developed to assess invertebrate welfare at scale: computer vision analyzes behavior, predictive models forecast stress, automated systems adjust environments. But with trillions of beings, human oversight is impossible—should AI systems make autonomous welfare decisions? With welfare in AI governance, these systems must prioritize welfare, but the scale raises questions about AI autonomy. Economic impacts concentrated in Asian aquaculture regions.",

AI systems managing animals will become more sophisticated, potentially making autonomous decisions for millions of animals. Some AI systems may demonstrate signs of sentience, raising questions about AI welfare itself. Cultivated meat/precision fermentation may reach price parity by 2030-2035. Zoonotic disease risks remain high (COVID-19, avian flu precedents). International trade will require harmonization of both animal welfare and AI governance. Current institutional capacity—funding, personnel, research infrastructure, AI oversight expertise—determines adaptive capacity.
